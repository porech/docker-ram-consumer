# docker-ram-consumer

A ridiculously simple Docker container that will just fill up your entire RAM when run.

## Why?

You tell me. We personally made this to test how our systems would behave when the RAM happens to be full. But be creative: you just probably shouldn't run it on your coworker's PC.
